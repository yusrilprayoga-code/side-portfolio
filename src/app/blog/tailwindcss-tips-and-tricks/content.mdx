## Styling Based on Other Elements
#### Tailwind CSS has some features that allow you to style an element based on another element.

* Styling children from parent element (&_*)
Generally, you can just put utility classes on any element to style it. But, there is a case where you don't have control over certain elements, like when you are using an external component.

* Styling based on Parent state (group-*)
Let's say you have a card component that has text, a link, and an icon inside it. When the user hovers over the card, you want to apply a style to text, link, and icon. To do that, you can put group class to the card element and put group-hover:{utility-class} to the text, link, and icon that you want to style.

* Styling based on Sibling state (peer-*)
You can use peer-{state}:{utility-class} to style an element based on its sibling state.

* Styling based on descendant (has-*)
There is also a way to style an element based on its children or descendants. The example use case for this is when looping a post list that the post item can contain an image or not.

## Writing and Customizing Classes
Tailwind CSS supports some ways to write and customize utility classes

* Custom class with Arbitrary Values
Custom class with Arbitrary Values is like writing css directly inside the class. It looks something like text-[#09836d] or mr-[75px]. You can use a class with Arbitrary as a last resort when you can't find a predefined utility class that fulfills your use case.

You can pass any value that is valid as css property value to a custom class. You can even pass Tailwind CSS variables. You can find more examples of Arbitrary values in official documentation.

One thing that usually becomes an issue when using a class with arbitrary value is when you need to pass a value with space. For example, when you want to pass box-shadow value 0 0 2px 0 #abcdef. In this case, you can replace the space with _, so the class will be shadow-[0_0_2px_0_#abcdef].

Keep in mind that a css class can't contain whitespace.

* Color Opacity
Did you know that you can apply opacity to your color classes?. It work on classes that contain color values like bg-{color}, text-{color}, border-{color}. You just need to add /{opacity-value} after the class. The opacity value is 0 to 100 with interval 5.

* Dynamic utility classes
When using a Front-end framework like React, Next.js, or Vue with Tailwind CSS, you often encounter the case when you have to generate Tailwind CSS class based on the variables or states

* Customize / Disable Tailwind container class
Tailwind CSS comes with a built-in responsive container class. The container will adjust in xs, sm, md, and lg breakpoints. By default, the container class has no padding and center positioning. But if you want to customize it, you can add container configurations in tailwind.config.js file.

* Combine Text size and Line height in 1 class
Usually, when you want to put a text size and line height class, you will put 2 classes, for example, text-base and leading-6. You can actually shorten them into a single class text-base/6. This will also work with arbitrary values or other line-height values like text-base/[40px] or text-base/small.

* Combine Width and Height in 1 class (size)
If you want to create a square element with the same width and height, you combine your width w-8 and height h-8 class into a single class size-8.
